# Data_Warehouse_Management

# Overview
This project involves creating an Apache Airflow DAG to automate the loading of logistics data into a Hive database on GCP Dataproc. The system ensures data is loaded efficiently and archived appropriately.

# Features
 + GCS Sensor: Detects new files in the logistics raw data bucket.
 + Hive Database and Tables: Creates Hive database and tables, including partitioned tables.
 + Dynamic Partitioning: Configures dynamic partitioning in Hive.
 + Data Archival: Moves processed files to an archive bucket.
 
 # DAG Components
 + sense_logistics_file: GCSObjectsWithPrefixExistenceSensor to detect new files.
 + create_hive_database: Creates Hive database if it doesn't exist.
 + create_hive_table: Creates the main Hive table.
 + create_partitioned_table: Creates a partitioned Hive table.
 + set_hive_properties_and_load_partitioned: Sets Hive properties and loads data into the partitioned table.
 + archive_processed_file: Moves processed files to an archive bucket.
